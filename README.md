# car-steering-wheel-control-switch-keyboard

After upgrading the car head unit to selfmade RaspberryPI 4 with Android https://konstakang.com/devices/rpi4/AOSP12/ the question arose, what to do with steering wheel control switch.
So, it can be easily upgraded to a Bluetooth keyboard which just connects to the head unit wirelessly.

As the board for Keyboard I used XIAO ESP32 C3.
Pinout:

- Put 200R resistor between ESP32 GND and ESP32 GPIO2
- Connect pin 1 from Steering Control Switch (SCS) to ESP32 3.3V
- Connect pin 2 from SCS to ESP32 GPIO2

Upload the code to ESP32 and that's it.

You may need to adopt values that represent button values on line 18.
